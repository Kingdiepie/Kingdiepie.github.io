						<h2>Informatics Usability Test</h2>
						<p>*This was conducted 2/19/18. This site will be/has been remade in Spring 2018*</p>
					</header>


<h4>My Site and the Tests:</h4><p>
I decided to choose my own website for this project becuase I thought it'd be more interesting
then doing s well known site like facebook. In addition, I am in the middle of rebuilding this
website and I wanted to know what elements users liked and what they thought was missing.
</p>
<h5>As for the actual test I had 5 tasks.</h5>
<ul><li>The first task was to find my Twitter account. While I don't use on a normally anymore I want the links to my social media to be easy to find but not intrusive. The links to social media are on the footer of my website so I thought it would be interesting to see if users would look there.</li>
<li>Find my "Flying Koopa" game and download the .rar. This test was to see if users used the home page or menu to find projects, and to see if users could download htings easily</li>
<li>Find my GPA calculator program and download it. This is very simliar to the last task but there is a search bar, and oyu must scroll down on the gome page to see calculator programs</li>
<li>Find my single-player pong game. This is part of my HTML5 Arcade that is not accesable without useing the menu. I also wanted them to try and figure out controls and see if they knew how to pause the game</li>
<li>The last test was easy, just return to the home page. I wanted to see if they would use the menu or click my name</li>
</ul>
<h5>Usability Heuristics</h5>
	<p>My current website has no real progress bars or loading screens anywhere. This is especially bad in games that need to load audio files. While I do use a few technical terms on my site, Most of the site is in plain English and the programming nonsense is mainly just for the people who want it, and isn't essential to the site. My site allows users to leave any page at anytime giving users good freedom when using the site. According to those I tested my site met the conventions that people expect to see on websites. Symbols and language were universal. There's no real error prevention on the site as well,even on pages that are mainly Javascript. I think navigation on my site is self-explanatory but my testers tried to access everything from links on the homepage rather than using the menu. There are several shortcuts on my website and between my two testers they used most of them. Aesthetically my website is pleasing but the version tested uses a CSS template, I also keep descriptions short so nothing is very wordy. My website doesn't have many opportunities to produce errors but when it does there is no handling of errors. My site and the projects on them have some documentation but more should be added.

	<h5>Test Results</h5>
		<p>Both my tests are available below in video/audio form. Both users were able to navgate back to the home screen with one click taking the shortcut. I testing my friends Cal and Gabe, they are both Computer Science Majors but I figured that was okay since my website in mainly my code projects and they are a part of my target audience. Both of them were able to navigate back to the home page with just one click. While they both found twitter relvativly fast they both first clicked on the share with twitter button. When they looked for the calculator program one decided to use the home page and another used themenu which was interesting. Neight of them used the searchbar,the decided it was easier to manually read down the list. Both of them reconized the download symbol but on commented it should also say the word download. Both of them found my "Flying  Koopa" gmae but one used the featured section on the front page and another used the menu to nagigate to projects. Finnaly the test that produced the most issues, find the singleplayer pong game. Both of the users had issues finding it. Both of them kept trying to find it in the "Full Projects". I eventually gave both of them a hint. The first user was just told that the game was playable on the site. Another was told that he should read the entire Menu. After they both read the whole menu they reconized that the game was in the Arcade section on the website and were able to find it from there. One of them had an error whileplaying thegame that was not properly handled either. Overall my users though the site was fairly easy to navigate and followed convention well. The main issues they said they had was that I had two Twitter buttons that did two different things, and that all the games weren't visable from the full project page.

		<p>The first video breaks when I went to full screen but I think the audio is still valuable.</p>

		<h5>Improvements</h5>
			<p>This test definently told me a lot about the improvements that I needed to make to my website when I release the new version. In the new versions I will likely only have one twitter button if I link to it at all. More importantly I will have the full menu at the top of the screen onlt condensing to a hamburger when it can't fit on screen. I also plan on including all projects including the HTML arcade on the projects page of the new site. As I add the projects back to the new site I also want to update them with better error handling/preventing while also adding better documentation and comments on my projects.</p><br>
