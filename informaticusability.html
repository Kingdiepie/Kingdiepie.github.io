<h4>My Site and the Test</h4><p>
I decided to choose my own website for this project becuase I thought it'd be more interesting
then doing s well known site like facebook. In addition, I am in the middle of rebuilding this
website and I wanted to know what elements users liked and what they htought was missing.
</p>
<p>As for the actual test I had 5 tasks.</p>
<ul><li>The first task was to find my Twitter account. While I don't use on a normally anymore I want the links to my social media to be easy to find but not intrusive. The links to social media are on the footer of my website so I thought it would be interesting to see if users would look there.</li>
<li>Find my "Flying Koopa" game and download the .rar. This test was to see if users used the home page or menu to find projects, and to see if users could download htings easily</li>
<li>Find my GPA calculator program and download it. This is very simliar tot he last task but there is a search bar, and oyu must scroll down on the gome page to see calculator programs</li>
<li>Find my single-player pong game. This is part of my HTML5 Arcade that is not accesable without useing the menu. I also wanted them to try and figure out controls and see if they knew how to pause the game</li>
<li>THe last test was easy, just return to the home page. I wanted to see if they would use the menu or click my name</li>
</ul>





=======
<p>As of now I will be attending Dominican University this fall to study Computer Science. I'll be working in IT at the support desk to earn some spending money and some experience while I study. My main project right now is Lisstr which is a web that allows people to make their own lists for power ranking anything(Sports Teams, Anime characters, etc)</p>
					<p>In addition the all my other programing projects I am also involved with the Build A Metagame Project (BAM). BAM is a fakedex the was made to create a competitive metagame with a GSC-like feel. It was recently rebooted and is in the early stages, but I am involved with Pokemon creation and creating and maintaining them <a href="https://bamdex.tk" >pokedex</a>, I may also host a pokemon showdown server again in the future. Feel free to get involved yourself at: <a href="https://bamforum.tk" >bamforum.tk.</a></p>
					<p>As for my interests outside programming I am semi-involved in competitive Pokemon on Showdown and Pokemon Perfect. I also play a fair amount of minecraft since I enjoy the open world and all the different ways you can modify the game. Finally, I enjoy football and politics to a degree.</p>
