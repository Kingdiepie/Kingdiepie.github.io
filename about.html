        Hi, I'm Dominik. I'm a Computer Science major at Dominican University in River Forest, IL. I enjoy many different aspects of programming. I enjoy everything from finding and coding the most effecient and/or creative solution to a problem to designing a project to be module and not cause us issues down the road.

        Currently I work IT at my school but am looking for a software or web development internship.
