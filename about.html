        Hi, I'm Dominik. I'm a Computer Science major at Dominican University in River Forest, IL. I enjoy many different aspects of programming. I enjoy everything from finding and coding the most effecient and/or creative solution to a problem to designing a project to be module and not cause us issues down the road.

        Currently I work IT at my school but am looking for a software or web development internship where I can gain experience in the field.

        I have a lot of hobbies, politics, football, Yugioh, and Pokemon just to name a few. One of the biggest projects I've worked on is a showcase for my love of pokemon. BAM or build-a-metagame is a project I've spent countless hours working with a group of friends to build a mod for a webside called <a href="pokemonshowdown.psim">Pokemon Showdown</a> that involved making fake pokemon in an attempt to start from scratch and make a balanced metagame.</p>
