  <h2>EQUIPMENT AND TECHNIQUES</h2><br>
	<br><hr>
 <h4>My Worksapce - HP Pavillion Laptop</h4>
    <img style="width: 20%;" src="laptop.png"/>
		<p style="width: 70%;">This laptop was my main workstation for the duration of my research and development. I needed a personal computer that I could use both at schol and at home with admin right. All of which are requirements that this computer fit. This Computer also left me with limitations, I was left with a dual core processor and eight gigabytes of RAM, which was enough for my script to work but required me to simplyify my numbers and calculations.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Data Source- Bureau of Labor Statistics and Other .gov Websites</h4>
	 <img style="width: 15%;" src="bls.png"/><br><br>
	 <p style="width: 70%;">All of my Data Tables with the needed information I got was from either Bureau of Labor Statistics or from a website maintained by the state I was collecting data from.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Data Storage - Google Sheets</h4>
	 <img style="width: 15%;" src="GoogleSheets.png"/><br><br>
	 <p style="width: 70%;">The data for companies, taxes, households etc, are stored on google sheets. I used google sheets as opposed to excel for financial reasons, auto-save, and being stored online made the design easy.</p>
<hr>
		<h4>Data Transfer - Gradle</h4>
			 <img style="width: 15%;" src="gradle.jpg"/><br><br>
			 <p style="width: 70%;">With all my data stored in Google Sheets I needed a way to export it to google drive. I quickly found Gradle, The set-up was somewaht complicated but after initial set up it was very easy to use and adapt. Since the gradle quickstart quide exacuted in the command prompt I decided to run the program there as well.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Text Editor - ATOM</h4>
	 <img style="width: 15%;" src="atom.png"/><br><br>
	 <p style="width: 70%;">Atom is a good all around text editor and is easily modified with plug-ins to compile and auto-complete for all languages.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Programming Language - Java</h4>
	 <img style="width: 15%;" src="java.jpg"/><br><br>
	 <p style="width: 70%;">I decided to use java for this project since it on of the languages I know best and it's Object Oriented style fit this project perfectly.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Program Environment - Command Prompt</h4>
	 <img style="width: 20%;" src="cmd.png"/>
	 <p style="width: 70%;">Due to the gradle quickstart I decided to stick with the command prompt as the physical area where a user would execute the program. Useing the command prompt as the USer Interface came with some pros and cons. By nature the command prompt made forced all user input the be based off text instead of buttons and the like but on the bright side it allowed to to focus on the calculations themselves as opposed to the user interface. Java also makes it very easy to send outputs and receive input from to command promt.</p>
